Description:
    FEDUP is an R package that tests for enrichment and depletion
    of user-defined pathways using a Fisher's exact test. This package is
    designed for versatile pathway annotation formats (eg. gmt, txt, xlsx) to
    allow the user to run pathway analysis on their annotations of choice.
    FEDUP is also integrated with Cytoscape to provide network-based pathway
    visualization that enhances the interpretability of enrichment results.
